# Bootstrap p-mo: Rust-based MCP Server

## Why
We need a reliable agent for handling common coding tasks out-of-band, including knowledge management, documentation-driven development, code review, and test management. This bootstrap plan focuses on setting up the initial infrastructure for the p-mo server.

## Technical Specification

### Architecture
- Rust-based HTTP server
- RESTful API for client interactions
- Vector datastore integration (starting with Qdrant)
- Command-line interface for local operations

### Core Components
1. Server infrastructure
2. CLI interface
3. API endpoints for Cline/Claude-Code integration
4. Vector store connector (Qdrant)
5. Basic knowledge management operations

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Rust project with Cargo
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Configure dependencies
- [ ] Create basic README with development instructions
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Server Implementation
- [ ] Implement basic HTTP server
- [ ] Create configuration management
- [ ] Implement logging
- [ ] Add health check endpoint
- [ ] Create server startup/shutdown procedures
- [ ] Write tests for server functionality

### Phase 3: CLI Interface
- [ ] Design CLI command structure
- [ ] Implement argument parsing
- [ ] Create help documentation
- [ ] Implement server control commands (start, stop, status)
- [ ] Write tests for CLI functionality

### Phase 4: API Implementation
- [ ] Define API contract
- [ ] Implement basic endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Write API tests

### Phase 5: Vector Store Integration
- [ ] Implement Qdrant connector
- [ ] Create text tokenization utilities
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for vector store
- [ ] Add query capabilities
- [ ] Write integration tests

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Server initialization and configuration
- CLI command parsing and execution
- API endpoint request/response handling
- Vector store operations

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end CLI to server communication
- Server to vector store operations
- Complete knowledge management workflows

### Performance Tests
- Response time for common operations
- Memory usage under load
- Concurrent request handling

## Minimal Viable Tests

1. **Server Test**: Verify server starts and responds to health check
```rust
#[test]
fn test_server_health_check() {
    // Start server
    // Send request to /health
    // Verify 200 OK response
}
```

2. **CLI Test**: Verify CLI can start/stop server
```rust
#[test]
fn test_cli_server_control() {
    // Execute CLI with start command
    // Verify server is running
    // Execute CLI with stop command
    // Verify server is stopped
}
```

3. **API Test**: Verify basic API functionality
```rust
#[test]
fn test_api_basic_operations() {
    // Send request to API endpoint
    // Verify correct response
}
```

4. **Vector Store Test**: Verify Qdrant connection
```rust
#[test]
fn test_qdrant_connection() {
    // Initialize Qdrant connector
    // Perform simple operation
    // Verify success
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with a minimal server implementation
2. Use iterative development with small, testable increments
3. Focus on one component at a time, ensuring it works before moving on
4. Maintain high test coverage throughout development
5. Regularly refactor to maintain code quality

## Success Criteria
- Server starts and responds to requests
- CLI can control server operations
- API endpoints are accessible and functional
- Vector store operations work correctly
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete and accurate

## Next Steps After Bootstrap
- Implement knowledge management features
- Add documentation-driven development capabilities
- Develop code review functionality
- Create test management features
