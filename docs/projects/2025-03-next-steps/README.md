# 2025-03 Next Steps

This project folder contains the next steps and roadmap for the progmo-mcp-server development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

1. Document the current state of the progmo-mcp-server
2. Outline prioritized next steps for development
3. Provide a clear roadmap for feature implementation
4. Track progress on key development areas

## Contents

- [EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md): High-level overview of project status and roadmap
- [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md): Comprehensive checklist of prioritized tasks for the project
- [TEST_PLAN.md](./TEST_PLAN.md): Detailed testing strategy for the next steps implementation
- [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md): Specific implementation guidance with code examples and timeline
- [PERSONAL_PREFERENCE_TOOL.md](./PERSONAL_PREFERENCE_TOOL.md): Specification for the personal preference tool

## How to Use This Document

The NEXT_STEPS.md document is organized into six major sections, each representing a key area of development:

1. Vector Store Integration
2. API Implementation
3. Knowledge Management Features
4. Documentation-Driven Development Features
5. Test Coverage Improvements
6. Code Review Features

Each section contains detailed tasks with checkboxes that can be marked as completed as development progresses.

## Implementation Strategy

When implementing these next steps, follow these guidelines:

1. Focus on completing one section at a time before moving to the next
2. Prioritize vector store integration and API implementation as foundational components
3. Maintain high test coverage throughout development
4. Regularly refactor to maintain code quality
5. Document all new features as they are implemented

## Progress Tracking

To track progress:

1. Update the checkboxes in NEXT_STEPS.md as tasks are completed
2. Add notes or comments about implementation details when relevant
3. Create new issues or tasks in your project management system based on these items
4. Reference the specific checklist items in commit messages and pull requests

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

- All vector store operations are fully implemented and tested
- API endpoints are complete with documentation
- Knowledge management features are operational
- Documentation-driven development tools are functional
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 75%
- Code review features are implemented and usable
