- Test coverage meets or exceeds 75%
- Code review features implemented and usable

## Implementation Strategy

1. Focus on one section at a time, completing it before moving to the next
2. Prioritize vector store integration and API implementation as foundational components
3. Maintain high test coverage throughout development
4. Regularly refactor to maintain code quality
5. Document all new features as they are implemented

## Prioritized Next Steps

Based on the current state of the project and recent progress, the following areas should be prioritized:

1. **Complete Vector Store Integration**
   - Implement embedding generation to replace placeholder embeddings
   - Add batch operations support for efficiency
   - Enhance text processing with improved chunking strategies

2. **Expand API Implementation**
   - Create knowledge management endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Implement search endpoints with filtering options
   - Add collection management endpoints

3. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Create integration tests for MCP tools
   - Implement a more comprehensive mock vector store
   - Add performance benchmarks for vector operations

4. **Implement Personal Preference Tool**
   - Design and implement preference storage system
   - Create MCP tools for preference management
   - Add preference inference from code and feedback

These priorities build on the foundation established with the MCP tools and move us closer to a fully functional knowledge management system.
