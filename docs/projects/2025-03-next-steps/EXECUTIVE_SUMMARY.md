# Executive Summary: progmo-mcp-server

## Project Overview

The progmo-mcp-server ("program more") is a Rust-based agent for handling common coding tasks out-of-band, including knowledge management, documentation-driven development, code review, and test management. It serves as an external brain for developers, providing context and assistance through integration with tools like Cline and other MCP clients.

## Current State

The project currently has a solid foundation with:

- Basic server infrastructure using Axum web framework
- CLI interface for server control (start/stop/status)
- Configuration management with TOML files
- Initial vector store integration (Qdrant) structure
- API models for knowledge entries
- Test infrastructure with unit and integration tests

The codebase follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns:
- Pure functions for core logic
- Effects-based modules for I/O and external interactions
- Trait-based design for extensibility

## Key Accomplishments

1. Established project structure and architecture
2. Implemented server startup/shutdown procedures
3. Created configuration management system
4. Set up CLI interface with command parsing
5. Designed initial API models
6. Implemented basic vector store connector
7. Created comprehensive test infrastructure

## Next Steps

The project roadmap is organized into six major phases:

1. **Complete Vector Store Integration** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Enhance Qdrant connector with connection pooling and error handling
   - Implement text processing utilities
   - Add document operations and query capabilities

2. **Expand API Implementation** (Weeks 5-8)
   - Create knowledge management endpoints
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add API documentation and error handling

3. **Implement Knowledge Management Features** (Weeks 9-12)
   - Add document ingestion and parsing
   - Implement semantic search
   - Create knowledge organization
   - Integrate with MCP

4. **Add Documentation-Driven Development Features** (Weeks 13-16)
   - Implement project structure and management
   - Create documentation versioning
   - Add progress tracking
   - Integrate with development tools

5. **Improve Test Coverage** (Weeks 17-20)
   - Implement test plan items
   - Add error path testing
   - Create performance tests
   - Address coverage gaps

6. **Implement Code Review Features** (Weeks 21-24)
   - Add branch management
   - Implement code analysis
   - Create test management
   - Build review workflow

## Success Metrics

The implementation will be considered successful when:

- All vector store operations are fully implemented and tested
- API endpoints are complete with documentation
- Knowledge management features are operational
- Documentation-driven development tools are functional
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 75%
- Code review features are implemented and usable

## Resource Requirements

To complete the next phases, the following resources are needed:

- **Development**: 1-2 Rust developers
- **Testing**: Access to Qdrant instance for vector store testing
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- **Documentation**: Technical writer for API documentation

## Timeline

The complete implementation is estimated to take 24 weeks (6 months), with major milestones at:

- Week 4: Vector store integration complete
- Week 8: API implementation complete
- Week 12: Knowledge management features complete
- Week 16: Documentation-driven development features complete
- Week 20: Test coverage improvements complete
- Week 24: Code review features complete

## Conclusion

The progmo-mcp-server project has established a solid foundation and is ready for the next phase of development. The planned features will create a powerful tool for developers to manage knowledge, documentation, code review, and testing. By following the detailed implementation plan, the project can be completed successfully within the estimated timeline.
