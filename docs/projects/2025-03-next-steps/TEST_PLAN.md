# Test Plan for Next Steps Implementation

This document outlines the testing strategy for the features described in the [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) checklist.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Pure Function Testing**: Extract complex logic into pure functions and test thoroughly
3. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify complete workflows
5. **Coverage Goals**: Maintain minimum 75% coverage, aim for 100%

## Testing Strategy by Feature Area

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up test infrastructure
- Implement vector store unit tests
- Create API endpoint tests
- Establish baseline coverage

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement vector store integration tests
- Create API workflow tests
- Add knowledge management tests
- Develop performance test suite

### Phase 3: System Testing (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement end-to-end tests
- Create DDD feature tests
- Add code review workflow tests
- Develop user acceptance tests

### Phase 4: Coverage Completion (Weeks 7-8)
- Identify and address coverage gaps
- Implement property-based tests
- Add fuzzing tests
- Complete error path testing

## Test Automation

- All tests should be automated and run in CI/CD pipeline
- Unit tests should run on every commit
- Integration tests should run on pull requests
- End-to-end tests should run before releases
- Performance tests should run weekly

## Test Reporting

- Generate coverage reports after test runs
- Track coverage trends over time
- Document test failures and resolutions
- Maintain test documentation alongside code

## Success Criteria

- All new features have comprehensive tests
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 75%
- All critical paths are tested
- Performance benchmarks are established and met
- Error handling is verified for all components
